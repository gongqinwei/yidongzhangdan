<br>
Hereby we are attaching the general terms of service by Bill.com. Please be adviced that these exact terms apply to Mobill.<br>
<br>
 <br>
GENERAL TERMS OF SERVICE<br>
 <br>
These General Terms of Service are a legal agreement (the "Agreement") between Bill.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Bill.com", "we", "us" or "our"), on the one hand, and you and any person or organization for which you act that has a Bill.com account (the "Subscriber"), on the other hand. You represent and warrant that you are of legal age and have the right and authority to enter into this Agreement on your own behalf and on behalf of the Subscriber, if applicable.  By clicking "I Accept" below, you agree that you and the Subscriber, if applicable, will be bound by the terms of this Agreement.  This Agreement incorporates by this reference terms and conditions displayed on the "Web Site," defined below.<br>
 <br>
1.      GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE BILL.COM SERVICE<br>
 <br>
Bill.com provides the Bill.com service (the "Service") through the Bill.com web site at the URL www.bill.com (the "Web Site").  Each Subscriber may access one or more of the three components of the Service through the Subscriber’s Bill.com account:  Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, and Console.  Sections 2 through 4 of this Agreement set forth the Service Schedule that applies to each of these three components.  Section 5 describes Bill Payment, and Section 6 sets forth general terms and conditions.<br>
 <br>
A Bill.com Accounts Payable Subscriber ("AP Subscriber") may invite you to create a free Accounts Receivable account, or a Bill.com Accounts Receivable Subscriber ("AR Subscriber") may invite you to create a free Accounts Payable account.  These free accounts enable you to use bill payment with the Subscriber who invited you, but you will not be able to use the other features described in the Service Schedule.<br>
 <br>
A Bill.com account may have multiple users with different roles, such as Administrator, Approver, Accountant, Clerk, Payer, Staff, or a user-defined custom role.  The functions of your role are as set forth in your Subscriber’s account on the Web Site and in applicable provisions of this Agreement.  Each Bill.com account must have at least one "Administrator" who may add additional users and designate their roles.<br>
 <br>
A.      Accounts Payable.  The Accounts Payable component of the Service includes one or more of the following services:<br>
 <br>
a.      Bill indexing and document management<br>
b.      Workflow and approvals<br>
c.       Synchronization of data with accounting software ("Sync")<br>
d.      Data Entry Service<br>
e.      Bill payment (payables, subject to separate Bill Payment Services Agreement)<br>
 <br>
B.      Accounts Receivable.  The Accounts Receivable component of the Service includes one or more of the following services:<br>
 <br>
a.      Invoice creation and import<br>
b.      Invoice management and customer reminders<br>
c.       Bill payment (receivables, addressed in Section 5 below)<br>
 <br>
C.      Console.  The Console component of the Service enables finance professionals and others to manage multiple Bill.com accounts.  A Bill.com account may be linked to a Console if the Bill.com account was created within the Console or if one of the console users is a user in a Bill.com account.<br>
 <br>
2.      BILL.COM ACCOUNTS PAYABLE SERVICE SCHEDULE<br>
 <br>
These terms and conditions govern use of the Accounts Payable component of the Service and supplement the General Terms and Conditions in Section 6 below.<br>
 <br>
2.1.            BILL INDEXING AND DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT.  An AP Subscriber may authorize one or more users to upload invoices, bills and other statements of account from vendors ("Bills") to the "Inbox" of the AP Subscriber’s Bill.com account directly through the Web Site or by email or fax, using the email or fax numbers assigned by Bill.com.  An AP Subscriber may also authorize vendors to send electronic Bills to the AP Subscriber’s Bill.com account using the email or fax numbers assigned by Bill.com.  Bill.com is not responsible for Bills that are misdirected or not received by Bill.com.  Each AP Subscriber should regularly review its Inbox to assure that expected Bills are there.  An AP Subscriber may also authorize one or more users to upload in the same way documents that are not Bills that the AP Subscriber wishes to store electronically ("Documents"). Without prior notice, Bill.com reserves the right to cancel and reassign fax numbers for accounts that have been inactive or for which the "Service Fees" (as defined in Section 6.3 below) are delinquent for thirty (30) days or more.<br>
 <br>
An AP Subscriber must designate each item in its Inbox as a new or existing Bill, vendor credit, vendor document or company document and input identifying details (such as vendor name, invoice number, invoice date, due date and amount ("Bill Details")).  If an AP Subscriber elects the Data Entry Service, Bill.com will provide the additional assistance described in Section 2.4 below.<br>
 <br>
2.2.            WORKFLOW. An Administrator of a Bill.com account may invite persons, such as the AP Subscriber’s employees or accountant, to establish login access to the Bill.com account.  The Administrator must define each user’s role, which may include managing vendors, Bills and Documents; approving Bills; managing payments and bank accounts; managing the account and users; accounting; or receivables.  In this way, the Administrator can manage how Bills are recorded, approved, and paid by the AP Subscriber.<br>
 <br>
2.3.            SYNC.  An AP Subscriber may choose to install Bill.com software that enables the AP Subscriber to update the AP Subscriber’s accounting software program file with the latest payables transactions in Bill.com, and synchronizes the list of accounts, classes, and vendors between the AP Subscriber’s Bill.com account and the AP Subscriber’s accounting software program.  An AP Subscriber can sync with certain online accounting software programs without installing Bill.com software.<br>
 <br>
2.4.            DATA ENTRY SERVICE. An AP Subscriber that is not associated with a Console may elect the Data Entry Service to help process documents in the "Inbox" of the AP Subscriber’s Bill.com account.  Alternatively, a Console Subscriber may elect the Data Entry Service for any Bill.com account associated with the Console.  Bill.com (or its service provider) will enter Bill Details for legible Bills and return Documents to the AP Subscriber’s "Inbox" for processing by the AP Subscriber.  The AP Subscriber can then review, edit, approve and pay Bills, apply credits, and organize Documents according to the AP Subscriber’s internal processes.<br>
 <br>
2.4.1.      Service Limitations.  Bill.com wants to make your use of Data Entry Service easy and productive.  But, Bill.com cannot always foresee or prevent technical, human or other difficulties.  These difficulties may result in incorrectly entered data, duplicate entries, lost Bills or other errors.  Accordingly, the AP Subscriber agrees to establish internal controls that can detect, correct and compensate for errors and failures of Data Entry Service.  If an AP Subscriber elects the Data Entry Service, the AP Subscriber expressly agrees that it understands the quality and limitations of Data Entry Service and agrees that they are commercially reasonable in light of the price and the AP Subscriber’s business needs.  The AP Subscriber retains responsibility for timely and correct payment of its Bills.<br>
 <br>
2.4.2.      Limited Warranty for Data Entry Service.  If Bill.com makes an error in Data Entry Service, and our error solely and directly results in a bill payment that is less than the amount due or later than the date due, unless otherwise required by law, our liability shall be limited to late penalties incurred and interest on the amount of the underpayment or late payment, calculated from the date due until the date it was actually made or the AP Subscriber canceled the instructions.  We may pay such interest either to the AP Subscriber or the intended recipient of the transfer, but in no event will we be liable to both parties, and our payment to either party will fully discharge any obligation to the other.  If we make an error in Data Entry Service, and our error solely and directly results in a bill payment that is greater than the amount due or earlier than the date due, unless otherwise required by law, our liability shall be limited to interest on the amount of the overpayment or early payment, calculated from the date actually made until the date due.  The AP Subscriber is responsible for obtaining a refund or credit from the recipient for the amount of the overpayment.  If we make an error in Data Entry Service and our error solely and directly results in a payment to an unauthorized party, we will be liable to refund the amount of the payment to the AP Subscriber, subject to the "Limitation of Liability" set forth in Section 6.9 below.  If we become liable for interest compensation under this Agreement or applicable law, such interest shall be calculated based on the average federal funds rate at the Federal Reserve Bank in the district where Bill.com is headquartered for each day interest is due, computed on the basis of a 360-day year.<br>
 <br>
If an AP Subscriber believes the AP Subscriber is entitled to payment under this warranty, the AP Subscriber must notify Bill.com Customer Support as soon as the AP Subscriber learns of the error (and in no event later than 30 days after the earlier of when the payment is due or made).  The AP Subscriber must cooperate fully with Bill.com’s remediation efforts by contacting the vendor, contacting the AP Subscriber’s bank, contacting the vendor’s bank, making information or funds available, executing all documents and taking all other actions reasonably requested to correct or mitigate the error.<br>
 <br>
THE FOREGOING SETS FORTH THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND BILL.COM’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE OBLIGATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY BREACH OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY.<br>
 <br>
2.4.3.      Warranty Exclusions; Warranty Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability.  The Warranty Exclusions, Warranty Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability set forth in Sections 6.7, 6.8 and 6.9 below, as well as the other General Terms and Conditions of Section 6, apply to the Limited Warranty set forth in the preceding Section 2.4.2.<br>
 <br>
2.5.            BILL PAYMENT.  Subject to separate Bill Payment Services Agreement.  <br>
 <br>
3.      BILL.COM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SERVICE SCHEDULE<br>
 <br>
These terms and conditions govern use of the Accounts Receivable component of the Service and supplement the General Terms and Conditions in Section 6 below.<br>
 <br>
3.1.            INVOICE CREATION AND IMPORT. An AR Subscriber may create invoices in the Subscriber’s Bill.com account, or the AR Subscriber may import invoices from the AR Subscriber’s QuickBooks™ accounting software package.  In each case, the AR Subscriber enters the Customer name and other items, which constitute "Invoice Details" for the Accounts Receivable component of the Service.<br>
 <br>
3.2.            INVOICE MANAGEMENT. An AR Subscriber may send invoices to Customers by email and track them through the Web Site.  The Service also enables an AR Subscriber to send reminders to Customers by email.<br>
 <br>
3.3.             BILL PAYMENT (RECEIVABLES). See Section 5 below.<br>
 <br>
4.                  BILL.COM CONSOLE SERVICE SCHEDULE<br>
 <br>
These terms and conditions govern use of the Console component of the Service and supplement the General Terms and Conditions in Section 6 below.<br>
 <br>
The Console component of the Service enables finance professionals and others to manage linked Bill.com accounts. A Console Subscriber can elect to have Bill.com’s monthly service fees charged to the Console Subscriber rather than to the linked Bill.com accounts.  Furthermore, a Console Subscriber can customize the linked Bill.com accounts with the Console Subscriber’s own logo.  Finally, the Console Subscriber can use the Console to set up Bill.com accounts for new clients.  A Console Subscriber that sets up a Bill.com account for a client and is not authorized to enter into these Terms of Service on the client’s behalf agrees that the Console Subscriber, and not the client, will be a party to this Agreement with respect to that account.<br>
 <br>
5.      BILL PAYMENT (RECEIVABLES)<br>
 <br>
These terms and conditions govern use of the bill payment component of the Service (the "Bill Payment Service") to receive electronic payments and supplement the General Terms and Conditions in Section 6 below. The Bill Payment Service may be used by an AR Subscriber to receive payments from a third party (a "Customer"), or by a third party (a "Vendor") to receive payments from an AP Subscriber.  In each case, the AP Subscriber or Customer will enter into a separate Bill Payment Terms of Service. Alternatively, an AP Subscriber or a Customer may elect to use PayPal or a credit card for bill payment, in which case PayPal’s or the credit card processor’s respective terms and conditions will apply instead.  In all cases, the AP Subscriber or AR Subscriber is responsible for paying Bill.com per transaction fees, as set forth on the Web Site.<br>
 <br>
5.1.            PAYMENT ACCOUNT. To use the Bill Payment Service, each AR Subscriber and Vendor must enter on the Web Site the bank routing number and bank account number for one or more bank accounts (each a "Payment Account").  When you enter Payment Account information, (1) you represent that you have authority to disclose the Payment Account information and to bind the Payment Account holder, (2) the Payment Account holder authorizes the initiation of debit or credit entries to the Payment Account in accordance with instructions input on the Web Site and, if necessary, the initiation of adjustments for any transactions debited in error, (3) you and the Payment Account holder acknowledge that transactions initiated to the Payment Account must comply with the provisions of U.S. law, and (4) this authorization will remain in effect until the Payment Account holder notifies Bill.com Customer Support on the Web Site or in writing to cancel it in such time as to afford Bill.com the opportunity to act on it, and (5) neither you nor the Payment Account holder will use the Service for personal, family, or household purposes except in connection with an accounting, bookkeeping, or other advisory business.<br>
 <br>
5.2.            VERIFICATION. Neither you nor any Subscriber, Customer, or Vendor may participate in the Bill Payment Service if Bill.com cannot verify your, the Subscriber’s, the Customer’s or the Vendor’s (as applicable) identity, financial condition, creditworthiness or other necessary information.  You authorize Bill.com, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries they consider necessary to validate your, the Subscriber’s, the Customer’s and the Vendor’s respective identities, financial condition and creditworthiness. This may include asking for further information, requiring steps to confirm ownership of email addresses and Payment Accounts, ordering a credit report and verifying information against third party databases or through other sources.  In addition, you, the Subscriber, the Customer and the Vendor each agree that Bill.com has the right to obtain financial information regarding the Payment Account from a financial institution or from anyone you pay or are paid by through the Service (for example, to resolve payment posting problems or for verification).  Notwithstanding any steps taken to verify information hereunder, you hereby represent and warrant that you have the right, power and authority to conduct and authorize transactions you make pertaining to any Payment Account and that all information you provided on the Web Site is complete, accurate and up to date.   If you use the Instant Verification Service on the Web Site, you further agree to the terms of Section 5.11 below.<br>
 <br>
5.3.            CUSTOMER SETUP (RECEIVABLES).  The AR Subscriber must provide a correct name and email address for each Customer.  The AR Subscriber represents and warrants to Bill.com that information the AR Subscriber inputs on the Web Site for the Customer is complete and accurately identifies the Customer, and that all Invoices are issued pursuant to a contractual relationship with the Customer pursuant to which funds are owed.  The AR Subscriber further agrees to assist Bill.com in verifying its Customers pursuant to Section 5.2 above and agrees that Bill.com may refuse to process transactions for any Customer whose identity, financial condition and creditworthiness cannot be verified to Bill.com’s satisfaction.<br>
 <br>
5.4.            PAYMENT PROCESSING. You agree that electronic payment transactions will be governed by the Automated Clearinghouse ("ACH") rules as in effect from time-to-time, under which the AP Subscriber or Customer is an "Originator", the AR Subscriber or Vendor is a "Receiver", Bill.com is a "Third Party Service Provider," and the bank that holds Bill.com’s master bank account is the "Originating Depository Financial Institution." Please see www.nacha.org. (NACHA - The Electronic Payments Association, develops operating rules and business practices for the ACH Network and for other areas of electronic payments.) <br>
 <br>
Bill.com reserves the right to debit a Receiver’s account if the ACH debit from an Originator’s Payment Account is returned because of insufficient funds or any other reason. The Originator shall be solely responsible for all penalties, interest charges, late payment fees and service fees resulting from such a debit to the Receiver.  In some cases, a Customer may reverse a transaction for up to 180 days after it settled, or an transaction may be invalidated for fraud or some other reason, in which case the funds will be removed from the Receiver’s Payment Account long after initial deposit.  You agree at all times to maintain sufficient funds in your Payment Account to satisfy all obligations including returns, reversals, and associated fees, and to add funds immediately if Bill.com notifies you that your funds are insufficient.<br>
 <br>
Bill.com may, in its discretion, contact a Subscriber’s Vendors or Customers regarding any payments to be made, or payments made, by the Subscriber for any reason. <br>
 <br>
Bill.com reserves the right to suspend or cancel any payments if the Subscriber’s Bill.com account is not in good standing.  Bill.com will credit back to the Payment Account any debits made to fund cancelled payments; provided, however, the Originator hereby authorizes Bill.com, in its sole discretion, to withhold and collect from such amounts any service fees or other amounts owed to Bill.com under this Agreement.<br>
 <br>
Bill.com reserves the right to make use of third parties to provide the Bill Payment Service.  Bill.com may, in its discretion, impose limits on the amount of money sent through the Bill Payment Service and may change those limits from time to time without notice to you.  These limits may apply per transaction; per AP Subscriber, AR Subscriber, Vendor, or Customer; or on a cumulative basis to any of the foregoing.<br>
 <br>
In recognition that banks do not make funds available immediately upon check deposit, and credit card processors do not make funds available immediately to merchants on the transaction date, each AR Subscriber agrees that as between it and its respective Customers, that payments via the ACH will be deemed to have been received on the payment date selected by the Customer for the purposes of determining whether the Customer has made timely payment of an Invoice. <br>
 <br>
5.5.            PROHIBITED PAYMENTS. Bill.com may refuse to issue a payment to any Vendor or AR Subscriber in its reasonable discretion.  The Bill Payment Service is not intended for payment of alimony, child support, taxes or other court-directed or government payments, fines or penalties, payments to settle securities transactions or payment in connection with gambling, fraudulent or illegal activities.  Bill.com will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide notice promptly if it refuses to issue a payment.  This notification is not required if an attempt is made to make a payment that is prohibited by law or the Agreement.<br>
 <br>
5.6.            PAYMENT REVIEW. Bill.com reviews all payments for risk and for compliance with law, including without limitation anti-money laundering laws and regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Asset Control ("Payment Review").  In its discretion, Bill.com may place a hold on a payment for as long as reasonably required to conduct an appropriate inquiry regarding the Subscriber, Vendor, Customer, Bill, Documents, Invoices, payment history, and other relevant circumstances and factors.  Depending on the results of this review, Bill.com may clear the payment, reverse the payment, or hold the payment pending instructions from a government agency.  At any time, a payment processed through your Payment Account may be reversed.<br>
 <br>
5.7.            TAXES.  It is the AR Subscriber’s and Customer’s responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to all payments made through the Web Site, and to collect, report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. Bill.com is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to these payments, or for collecting, reporting or remitting any taxes arising from any payments.<br>
 <br>
6.      GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO THE SERVICE<br>
 <br>
These General Terms and Conditions apply to users of any component of the Service and to the Bill Payment Service, except where otherwise expressly noted below.<br>
  <br>
6.1.            PASSWORDS AND SECURITY.  You shall not give or make available passwords or other means of accessing the Web Site to any unauthorized individuals.

For your protection, sign off after every Bill.com session and close your browser. If you choose to access your account through Intuit Workplace, PayPal or GoogleApps, you are making a determination that those login procedures are sufficiently secure for your purposes.

Bill.com will not have any liability to you for any unauthorized payment or transfer made using your password that occurs before you have notified Bill.com of possible unauthorized use and we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that notice.  Accordingly, you should log into your Bill.com account regularly and review your transaction history for unauthorized transactions or access.   By using the Web Site, you acknowledge and agree that this Agreement sets forth security procedures that are commercially reasonable.

 <br>
6.2.            CONSENT TO ELECTRONIC DISCLOSURES. You agree that Bill.com, on behalf of itself and third parties who administer services you choose, may send the following to you by email or by posting them on the Web Site:  this Agreement, including legal disclosures; future changes to this Agreement; Bill.com’s Privacy Policy; and other notices, legal communications or disclosures and information related to the Service or the Bill Payment Service (the "Communications").  You consent to receive these Communications electronically.  You agree to notify us promptly if your email address changes.

 <br>

Each Subscriber shall pay to Bill.com the fees and other charges applicable to the Service and the Bill Payment Service, if any, including without limitation monthly service fees, per payment fees, exceptions processing, setup and other special services and as set forth on the Web Site ("Service Fees").  Bill.com reserves the right to change the Service Fees from time to time, in its sole discretion. Bill.com will post the revised Service Fees on the Web Site or notify Subscribers by email in advance of the effective date of such changes ("Fee Increase Date").  If the change in Service Fees is not acceptable, Subscriber’s sole and exclusive remedy shall be to stop using the Service and cancel Subscriber’s account by notifying Bill.com Customer Support prior to the Fee Increase Date. By continuing to use the Service or Bill Payment Service after the Fee Increase Date, Subscriber accepts all changes in Service Fees. Service Fees are not refundable.<br>
 <br>

If Bill.com is unable to debit the Billing Account for any reason, all past due Service Fees and Taxes shall be paid within five (5) business days after written demand.  Interest shall accrue on past due amounts at the rate of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month, but in no event greater than the highest rate of interest allowed by law, calculated from the date such amount was due until the date that payment is received.  Bill.com shall be entitled to reimbursement for the reasonable costs of collection, including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys.<br>
 <br>

 <br>
6.6.            LIMITED WARRANTY FOR THE SERVICE.  Bill.com warrants to each Subscriber that the Service will perform substantially in accordance with the description on the Web Site.

6.11.        ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.  The parties acknowledge that the limitations and exclusions contained in Section 6 and elsewhere in this Agreement represent the parties’ agreement based upon the perceived level of risk associated with their respective obligations under this Agreement and the Service Fees paid hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the provisions hereof that limit liability, disclaim warranties or exclude consequential damages or other damages or remedies shall be severable and independent of any other provisions and shall be enforced as such, regardless of any breach hereunder, and (b) all limitations of liability, disclaimers of warranties, and exclusions of consequential damages or other damages or remedies shall remain fully valid, effective and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, even under circumstances that cause an exclusive remedy to fail of its essential purpose.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF DAMAGES, LIABILITY OR CERTAIN WARRANTIES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY.<br>
 <br>
6.12.        TERMINATION.  The Subscriber may terminate the Service at any time by submitting an account cancellation request through the Web Site or by contacting Bill.com Customer Support, provided that all payments in Subscriber’s Bill.com account have cleared.  Bill.com may terminate the Service or the Bill Payment Service at any time, for any reason (including failure to pay Service Fees or inactivity).  Bill.com will try to notify you in advance, but is not obliged to do so. If Subscriber cancels the Service, all accrued Service Fees will be immediately due and payable, including pro-rated monthly fees for the month of termination.

Bill.com may, in its sole discretion, permit Subscriber to continue accessing Subscriber’s data, Bills and Documents through the Service for a limited period of time after termination.  Subscriber may request Bill.com’s assistance in obtaining a copy of Subscriber’s data, Bills and Documents by notifying Bill.com within sixty (60) days following Service termination.  Thereafter, Bill.com may destroy or otherwise dispose of any such data, Bills or Documents in its possession.  Bill.com will invoice Subscriber for the cost of returning the data, Bills and Documents at Bill.com’s then-current rates.<br>

Bill.com will post the revised terms and conditions of the Agreement or policies on the Web Site and provide notice in advance of the effective date of such changes ("Amendment Date").  If the revised terms and conditions or policies are not acceptable, your sole and exclusive remedy shall be to stop using the Service and to cancel your account through the Web Site or by notifying Bill.com Customer Support prior to the Amendment Date. Continuing to use the Service and failing to cancel your account after the Amendment Date constitutes acceptance of the revised terms and conditions of the Agreement.  Except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement may not be modified or amended except in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative of each party.<br>
 <br>

The Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between the parties concerning its subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, written or oral, concerning such subject matter.  The headings in the Agreement are for convenience of reference only and have no legal effect.  You may not assign or transfer the Agreement, in whole or in part, without Bill.com’s written consent.  Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this Section 6.15 will be null and void.  Bill.com may assign its rights or delegate its obligations hereunder without consent.
